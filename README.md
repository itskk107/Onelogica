Introduction:
We have chosen the use case of predicting stock prices for Meta using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks.
Reasoning:
The integration of social media and news sentiment analysis enhances the predictive power of the model, capturing real-time market dynamics.
Objective:
To develop a dynamic and adaptive model that incorporates both historical stock prices and external factors like social media sentiment.
